# todo-list

:rocket: [Demo](https://todo-list-vue2.vercel.app/#/)

Todo list app based on [Vue JS Crash Course (2019)](https://youtu.be/Wy9q22isx3U) by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)

**Goal** I want to explore and learn VueJs and how it compares to React. 

How to **create components**, pass data from child to parent component, **make http requests** with axios (get, post, delete) and **define routes** with Vue router.
